## Coala Pay XPR Library Prototype

The intent of this library is to extend Coala Pay to support the XRP protocol. 

Where organisations can create an NFT representing their funding needs, and donors can offer to purchase the NFT.

This library provides all the capabilities to faciliate donor and funding flows in an abstraction.

We will be building additional capabilities in the near future realising features such as conditional automated funding releases and more.
